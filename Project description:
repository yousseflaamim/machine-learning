Project description:

This project involves developing a Flask application that uses a deep learning model to make predictions 
based on data sent via a REST API. The model is implemented with PyTorch and is trained to predict specific outputs based on given inputs.

The project starts by defining a class for the neural network model. The model consists of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output
layer. By using the activation function, in this case ReLU, the model can learn to extract relevant features from the input and generate the correct output.

After defining the model, predefined weights are loaded from the file (train_model1.pth) for use in predictions. This makes it possible to use a 
model that is already trained instead of training it from scratch.

Next, the Flask application is created and the "expect" REST API method is selected. When a POST request is received via the "/predict" endpoint, the received
data is extracted and converted to a tensor to match the format of the form's input. The preloaded model is then used to make a prediction based on the 
received data. The result is converted to text and returned as a response from the REST API.

The application can then be started and run on localhost using the built-in Flask server.

This project allows users to use Flask as a service to make predictions using a trained deep learning model. It can be used
for various purposes, such as forecasting prices, categorizing data or analyzing patterns in incoming data. In this project, we have trained the machine to predict
oil prices, and this helps companies to compete and know their prices to earn or reduce companies' losses when they speculate.
